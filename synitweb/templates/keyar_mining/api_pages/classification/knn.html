        <h1 class="h1">KNN Algorithm</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            k-NN is a type of classification where the function is only approximated locally 
            and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on 
            distance for classification, if the features represent different physical units or come in 
            vastly different scales then normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically.
            Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the 
            contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than 
            the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor 
            a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor. The neighbors are taken from a set 
            of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value 
            (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, 
            though no explicit training step is required. A peculiarity of the k-NN algorithm is that 
            it is sensitive to the local structure of the data.
