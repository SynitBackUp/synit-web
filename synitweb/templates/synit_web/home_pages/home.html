            The API that i made is use for specific dataset, you can also get the model or architecture that
            i use for training the dataset or you can use the pretrained model that already train for 
            specific dataset.

                Machine Learning API is about the API that using machine learning to solve easy task
                that can be solve fast than using deep learning, in this API there's no model deep neural
                network just basic machine learning model.

                Deep Learning API is about the API that using deep learning to solve complex task or problem
                or to solve complex problem like complex images that can't be solve by basic machine learning
                model.

            The project that i made just for fun, you can contribute the project that i make, and also you can
            give me some feedback, i really appreciate if you give me some feedback because i still learning.
